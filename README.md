# Shopping cart kataðŸ›’
The implementation of this Shopping cart kata REST API is a task part of the application process for a Software Developer at Spareroom.

## The Task
To implement a simple checkout system where there are four products available, each with a price per unit. 
Some products have a special price when bought in certain quantities (e.g. 3 of product A costs 140, not 150). 
The checkout system consumes a data source like [this](https://spareroom.github.io/recruitment/docs/cart-kata/data-set-1.json), and returns the sub total when queried.

## Implementation
The Shopping Cart system was implemented as a REST API using Java and Spring Boot. 
Additionally, Maven is required to run this API. 
Unit Test cases were written using JUnit, and the endpoints were documented using Swagger and following the OpenAPI spec.
Coverage report for the tests can be found in a separate repo [here](https://github.com/eymaal/spareroom-shopping-cart-kata-test-report).

## To run this API,
Navigate to the directory and the run the following commands:

```mvn clean```

```mvn spring-boot:run```

The server is configured to run on port 8080. Once the server has started, details about the endpoints can be found [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html)
